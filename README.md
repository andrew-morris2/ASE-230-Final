Final project for our ASE-230 class. This project encompasses a variety of skills we have learned throughout the course. Some of the skills are learning how to set up a SQL Database, using PHP for data handling and dynamic displaying
of HTML content, and authentication mechanisms, such as signing in, signing out, and signing up.
